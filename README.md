**My Unofficial Monkeytype Year in Review Tool**

Welcome to **Monkeywrap**! This is a tool I built for myself and the Monkeytype community to visualize typing stats in a fun, Spotify Wrapped-inspired format. It connects directly to [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) to celebrate our typing journeys.

## Disclaimer
This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Monkeytype** in any official capacity. It is a personal project built out of my passion for typing and the community.

## Features
- **My Personal Stats**: See your WPM, accuracy, and consistency visualized beautifully.
- **Interactive Story**: Experience your year through a narrative deck of cards.
- **Custom Themes**: I've added support for top Monkeytype themes like Serika Dark, Carbon, and Botanical.
- **Keyboard Tracking**: Attempts to identify your keyboard setup from your profile.
- **Background Music**: Integrated lofi beats to enjoy while viewing your wrap.

## How I Built This
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
